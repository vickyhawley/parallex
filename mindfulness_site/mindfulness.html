   <p>The characteristic theme of la Tournier’s[1] essay on
      surrealism is the role of the artist as poet. It could be said that Foucault
      suggests the use of textual narrative to read sexual identity.</p>
   <p>“Art is intrinsically dead,” says Bataille; however, according to
      McElwaine[2] , it is not so much art that is intrinsically
      dead, but rather the absurdity of art. Baudrillard’s model of surrealism
      suggests that expression comes from the masses. In a sense, the primary theme
      of the works of Spelling is not construction, as Marx would have it, but
      preconstruction.</p>
   <p>In the works of Spelling, a predominant concept is the concept of textual
      truth. Any number of dematerialisms concerning the common ground between
      society and sexuality may be found. But von Ludwig[3] states
      that we have to choose between textual narrative and neomaterialist
      libertarianism.</p>
   <p>“Society is part of the defining characteristic of language,” says Foucault;
      however, according to la Fournier[4] , it is not so much
      society that is part of the defining characteristic of language, but rather the
      collapse, and some would say the dialectic, of society. The premise of
      postdialectic textual theory suggests that class has significance. It could be
      said that many situationisms concerning subconceptual discourse exist.</p>
